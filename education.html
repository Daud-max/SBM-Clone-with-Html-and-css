        <h1>Government Girls High School Mustimba Muzaffarabad AJK</h1>
        <p>
          Girls High School Mustimba has been completed in 2018 funded by
          <b>WAVE Australia</b> and constructed by CDRS, the only girl’s school
          in the <b>15km radius.</b> The school was established in 1982 but
          unfortunately it was destroyed by the 1992s flood. The girls would sit
          on the bare and cold ground. In fact, lack of adequate educational
          facilities are the primary reason why most of the girls would drop out
          from high schools, despite AJK having one of the best enrolment rates
          at the primary school level. In remote areas of Azad Kashmir, most of
          the Schools have no buildings; Students are sitting under an open sky,
          during rains, snow, and hard weather which affect them badly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The young girls of High School Mustimba, now have a roof over their
          heads and chairs to sit on for their noble aim of education. They have
          a bright future ahead of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have maintained the entire standard-essential by ERA and used the
          quality material that will be appropriate for the both hot and summer
          season with the cost of 1.34 Million. It has benefited 300 students.
          We handed over the school building to the Education Department,
          Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and also established the local
          management committee that would be responsible to look after the
          school building.
        </p>
        <h1>Impartial</h1>
        <p>
          We provide the shelter for the students especially girls to study in a
          comfortable environment and maximize the attendance of students and
          teachers. We also arranged the furniture and fixture for the Students
          and teachers to improve their educational engagement with respect. Our
          objective was to ensure that children especially girls get another
          chance to complete their education. The children who didn’t go to
          school after the earthquake due to demolish school building again join
          their school for getting their aims of life.

        <h1>
          Government Higher Secondary School Kassian Halal, Muzafarabad AJK
        </h1>
        <p>
          Kassiyan Hallal, a village near Muzafarabad, has a population of about
          5,000. In the winter heavy snowfall cuts off the village from the main
          city and the isolated community further presents an image of a
          desolate landscape. Consequently, children are locked up inside the
          houses. This is how the problem starts – the students or the
          prospective leaders of the area are left with two choices: either be
          forced to sit on the cold and wet floor of schools or skip classes.
          This dilemma is further exacerbated, as the duration of snowfall also
          coincides with the end of the year examinations. The area is fall
          among those areas that has highest primary school children in
          Pakistan. Most of the schools are yet to be rebuilt even
          <b>after 14 years</b> since the unfortunate earthquake of 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
          There exists only one Science Higher Secondary School in the entire
          area of two union councils comprising approximately 80,000
          individuals. Science Higher Secondary School Kassian Halal is also a
          coeducational institute with over 65% of the females. The school
          previously lacked basic shelter and furniture; students were forced to
          continue their education out in the open without any protection from
          the elements of nature. We have maintained the entire
          standard-essential by ERA and used the quality material that will be
          appropriate for the both hot and summer season with the cost of
          <b>2.17 Million</b>. It has benefited <b>320 students </b>The School
          building had completed on <b>16 November 2019</b> with the help of
          donor <b>WAVE Australia</b>
          and handed over to the Education Department, Government of Azad Jammu
          and Kashmir, and also established the local management committee that
          would be responsible for look after the school building.
